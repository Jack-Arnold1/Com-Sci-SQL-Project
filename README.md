# Com-Sci-SQL-Project
# Description
Comsci project for CS ATAR class, using SQL to create a database for a business.

All other work (not source code) will be included in the README (here) for now, may move to another file later.

Ignore the HTML thing from before, now I might make a ui similar to the papa's pizza project that we did
I was thinking of doing for that asignment but dropped it due to time constraints

As usual, I will likely conjoin the investigation phase and development phase, 
creating a 'draft' program just because the development is the fun part
and investigating is boring :

Note: This is my first time using GitHub/Git for anything ever
so I may be doing thing improperly, (like the readme formatting?)



# INVESTIGATE
# Development Timeline
Week 3 - Investigate Phase
Week 4 - Development Phase
Week 5 - Evaluation Phase
Week 6 - Final Review, ensure final project meets all requirements before submitting
# Actual Timeline
Week 3(monday) - Investigation phase mostly complete?



# Problem Outline
A SQL database, primarily made to store customer's details for a family member's business idea.

The database should be able to store important details (like addresses, name, phone number),
and should have a primary key to seperate every customer (phone number?)
