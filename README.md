# Com-Sci-SQL-Project
# Description
Comsci project for CS ATAR class, using SQL to create a database for a business.

All other work (not source code) will be included in the README (here) for now, may move to another file later.

If I feel like overdoing it, I may (MAYBE) might make a website to make it actually work
(So "customers" can enter their details themselves)
I know basic HTML at this point, I think I would primarily have to learn JS to make the website function
and maybe CSS if I feel like making it look fancy.

As usual, I will likely conjoin the investigation phase and development phase, 
creating a 'draft' program just because the development is the fun part
and investigating is boring :)

Note: This is my first time using GitHub/Git for anything ever
so I may be doing thing improperly, (like the readme formatting?)

# Problem Outline
A SQL database, primarily made to store customer's details for a family member's business idea.

The database should be able to store important details (like addresses, name, phone number),
and should have a primary key to seperate every customer (phone number?)
